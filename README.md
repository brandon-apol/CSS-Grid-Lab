Directions: Explore CSS - Grid by commenting out or uncommenting various sections of the provided code. 

Feel free to modify the numbers in the CSS to see what behavior changes as you edit it. We encourage experimentation and exploration of your own - you can't
break our code, and you can come back to look at it if you get too lost with it.

Be sure to watch the video on CSS-grid in tandem with this sandbox.
